# Decently productive day

React reading:
- StrictMode enables the following developer only behaviours:
	- components will re-render an extra time:
		- to find bugs caused by impure rendering
	- components will re-run Effects an extra time:
		- to find bugs caused by missing Effects cleanup
	- components will be checked for usage of depreciated APIs

This is important to remember because that means that it solves the mystery as to why the weather app calls the API twice.
		
- react classes and javascript classes may have similar functionality but they are not the same thing

Arrow functional component:

```
const App = () => {...}
```

In order to get react .env variables to work you need to have react-scripts@0.2.3 or higher and all environment variables need to start with 'REACT_APP_'

Netlify really does fail a build when the linter gives a warning.


I got Netlify to publish my weather app properly as well as the warhammer damage app. Now to start work on the portfolio website.
