#StrictMode

- StrictMode enables the following developer only behaviours:
	- components will re-render an extra time:
		- to find bugs caused by impure rendering
	- components will re-run Effects an extra time:
		- to find bugs caused by missing Effects cleanup
	- components will be checked for usage of depreciated APIs
